* What I'd like to improve:  
  There isn't a music API service out there that lets you search tracks by artist's country of origin.  Instead we used the country where the track was released.  For smaller countries this is suboptimal as tracks released there by international superstars tend to swamp those by local artists.  Given more time, we'd need to search for data with broader parameters and then refine it ourselves, or build our own music database.
